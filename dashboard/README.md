# 🎬 Movies Dashboard

This folder contains an interactive dashboard for visualizing movies data extracted from The Movie Database (TMDB). The dashboard is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), and is designed to help users explore and analyze movies currently in theaters around the world.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **app.py**: Main entry point for the Streamlit dashboard. Contains the layout and logic for displaying plots, tables, and interactive widgets.
- **src/**: Source code for data loading and visualization functions. Modularized for maintainability and scalability.
    - `data_loaders.py`: Functions for loading data from the SQLite database.
    - `visualizations.py`: Functions for creating interactive Plotly charts.
    - (Other utility modules as needed)
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the dashboard.
- **Dockerfile**: Configuration for building a Docker image to deploy the dashboard in a production environment.
- **utils.py**: Additional utility functions (if any).

## 🚀 Features
- Visualize the most popular movies currently in theaters
- Explore genre distributions, language statistics, and rating distributions
- Interactive plots and tables powered by Plotly and Streamlit
- Modular codebase for easy extension and maintenance

## 🏗️ How to Run

### 1. Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Make sure your SQLite database (e.g., `movies.db`) is available in the expected location (see `src/data_loaders.py`).
3. Run the dashboard:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
4. Open your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### 2. Run with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t movies-dashboard .
    ```
2. Run the container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 movies-dashboard
    ```
3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## 📝 Notes
- The dashboard expects a SQLite database with movies data, typically generated by an ETL pipeline.
- You can customize or extend the dashboard by adding new functions to the `src/` directory and updating `app.py`.
- For more details on the ETL process or the data source, see the [ETL_movies_analysis repository](https://github.com/juasesan/ETL_movies_analysis).
